103-1240-0000 CHAPTER ONE MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE IS SURPRISED MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE LIVED JUST WHERE THE AVONLEA MAIN ROAD DIPPED DOWN INTO A LITTLE HOLLOW FRINGED WITH ALDERS AND LADIES EARDROPS AND TRAVERSED BY A BROOK
103-1240-0001 THAT HAD ITS SOURCE AWAY BACK IN THE WOODS OF THE OLD CUTHBERT PLACE IT WAS REPUTED TO BE AN INTRICATE HEADLONG BROOK IN ITS EARLIER COURSE THROUGH THOSE WOODS WITH DARK SECRETS OF POOL AND CASCADE BUT BY THE TIME IT REACHED LYNDE'S HOLLOW IT WAS A QUIET WELL CONDUCTED LITTLE STREAM
103-1240-0002 FOR NOT EVEN A BROOK COULD RUN PAST MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE'S DOOR WITHOUT DUE REGARD FOR DECENCY AND DECORUM IT PROBABLY WAS CONSCIOUS THAT MISSUS RACHEL WAS SITTING AT HER WINDOW KEEPING A SHARP EYE ON EVERYTHING THAT PASSED FROM BROOKS AND CHILDREN UP
103-1240-0003 AND THAT IF SHE NOTICED ANYTHING ODD OR OUT OF PLACE SHE WOULD NEVER REST UNTIL SHE HAD FERRETED OUT THE WHYS AND WHEREFORES THEREOF THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE IN AVONLEA AND OUT OF IT WHO CAN ATTEND CLOSELY TO THEIR NEIGHBOR'S BUSINESS BY DINT OF NEGLECTING THEIR OWN
103-1240-0004 BUT MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE WAS ONE OF THOSE CAPABLE CREATURES WHO CAN MANAGE THEIR OWN CONCERNS AND THOSE OF OTHER FOLKS INTO THE BARGAIN SHE WAS A NOTABLE HOUSEWIFE HER WORK WAS ALWAYS DONE AND WELL DONE SHE RAN THE SEWING CIRCLE
103-1240-0005 HELPED RUN THE SUNDAY SCHOOL AND WAS THE STRONGEST PROP OF THE CHURCH AID SOCIETY AND FOREIGN MISSIONS AUXILIARY YET WITH ALL THIS MISSUS RACHEL FOUND ABUNDANT TIME TO SIT FOR HOURS AT HER KITCHEN WINDOW KNITTING COTTON WARP QUILTS SHE HAD KNITTED SIXTEEN OF THEM
103-1240-0006 AS AVONLEA HOUSEKEEPERS WERE WONT TO TELL IN AWED VOICES AND KEEPING A SHARP EYE ON THE MAIN ROAD THAT CROSSED THE HOLLOW AND WOUND UP THE STEEP RED HILL BEYOND
103-1240-0007 ANYBODY WHO WENT OUT OF IT OR INTO IT HAD TO PASS OVER THAT HILL ROAD AND SO RUN THE UNSEEN GAUNTLET OF MISSUS RACHEL'S ALL SEEING EYE SHE WAS SITTING THERE ONE AFTERNOON IN EARLY JUNE THE SUN WAS COMING IN AT THE WINDOW WARM AND BRIGHT
103-1240-0008 THE ORCHARD ON THE SLOPE BELOW THE HOUSE WAS IN A BRIDAL FLUSH OF PINKY WHITE BLOOM HUMMED OVER BY A MYRIAD OF BEES THOMAS LYNDE A MEEK LITTLE MAN WHOM AVONLEA PEOPLE CALLED RACHEL LYNDE'S HUSBAND WAS SOWING HIS LATE TURNIP SEED ON THE HILL FIELD BEYOND THE BARN
103-1240-0009 MISSUS RACHEL KNEW THAT HE OUGHT BECAUSE SHE HAD HEARD HIM TELL PETER MORRISON THE EVENING BEFORE IN WILLIAM J BLAIR'S STORE OVER AT CARMODY THAT HE MEANT TO SOW HIS TURNIP SEED THE NEXT AFTERNOON
103-1240-0010 PETER HAD ASKED HIM OF COURSE FOR MATTHEW CUTHBERT HAD NEVER BEEN KNOWN TO VOLUNTEER INFORMATION ABOUT ANYTHING IN HIS WHOLE LIFE AND YET HERE WAS MATTHEW CUTHBERT AT HALF PAST THREE ON THE AFTERNOON OF A BUSY DAY PLACIDLY DRIVING OVER THE HOLLOW AND UP THE HILL
103-1240-0011 AND HIS BEST SUIT OF CLOTHES WHICH WAS PLAIN PROOF THAT HE WAS GOING OUT OF AVONLEA AND HE HAD THE BUGGY AND THE SORREL MARE WHICH BETOKENED THAT HE WAS GOING A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE NOW WHERE WAS MATTHEW CUTHBERT GOING AND WHY WAS HE GOING THERE
103-1240-0012 HAD IT BEEN ANY OTHER MAN IN AVONLEA MISSUS RACHEL DEFTLY PUTTING THIS AND THAT TOGETHER MIGHT HAVE GIVEN A PRETTY GOOD GUESS AS TO BOTH QUESTIONS BUT MATTHEW SO RARELY WENT FROM HOME THAT IT MUST BE SOMETHING PRESSING AND UNUSUAL WHICH WAS TAKING HIM
103-1240-0013 HE WAS THE SHYEST MAN ALIVE AND HATED TO HAVE TO GO AMONG STRANGERS OR TO ANY PLACE WHERE HE MIGHT HAVE TO TALK MATTHEW DRESSED UP WITH A WHITE COLLAR AND DRIVING IN A BUGGY WAS SOMETHING THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN OFTEN MISSUS RACHEL PONDER AS SHE MIGHT COULD MAKE NOTHING OF IT
103-1240-0014 AND HER AFTERNOON'S ENJOYMENT WAS SPOILED I'LL JUST STEP OVER TO GREEN GABLES AFTER TEA AND FIND OUT FROM MARILLA WHERE HE'S GONE AND WHY THE WORTHY WOMAN FINALLY CONCLUDED HE DOESN'T GENERALLY GO TO TOWN THIS TIME OF YEAR AND HE NEVER VISITS
103-1240-0015 IF HE'D RUN OUT OF TURNIP SEED HE WOULDN'T DRESS UP AND TAKE THE BUGGY TO GO FOR MORE
103-1240-0016 YET SOMETHING MUST HAVE HAPPENED SINCE LAST NIGHT TO START HIM OFF I'M CLEAN PUZZLED THAT'S WHAT AND I WON'T KNOW A MINUTE'S PEACE OF MIND OR CONSCIENCE UNTIL I KNOW WHAT HAS TAKEN MATTHEW CUTHBERT OUT OF AVONLEA TODAY ACCORDINGLY AFTER TEA MISSUS RACHEL SET OUT SHE HAD NOT FAR TO GO
103-1240-0017 THE BIG RAMBLING ORCHARD EMBOWERED HOUSE WHERE THE CUTHBERTS LIVED WAS A SCANT QUARTER OF A MILE UP THE ROAD FROM LYNDE'S HOLLOW TO BE SURE THE LONG LANE MADE IT A GOOD DEAL FURTHER MATTHEW CUTHBERT'S FATHER AS SHY AND SILENT AS HIS SON AFTER HIM
103-1240-0018 HAD GOT AS FAR AWAY AS HE POSSIBLY COULD FROM HIS FELLOW MEN WITHOUT ACTUALLY RETREATING INTO THE WOODS WHEN HE FOUNDED HIS HOMESTEAD GREEN GABLES WAS BUILT AT THE FURTHEST EDGE OF HIS CLEARED LAND AND THERE IT WAS TO THIS DAY
103-1240-0019 BARELY VISIBLE FROM THE MAIN ROAD ALONG WHICH ALL THE OTHER AVONLEA HOUSES WERE SO SOCIABLY SITUATED MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE DID NOT CALL LIVING IN SUCH A PLACE LIVING AT ALL IT'S JUST STAYING THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID AS SHE STEPPED ALONG THE DEEP RUTTED GRASSY LANE
